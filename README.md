## **ABV** 

**A**lready **B**een **V**aped cannabis (Also known as AVB: **A**lready **V**aped **B**ud; vape poo; and duff).  It can be re-used for edibles or tinctures.  It may also be smoked - though this largely defeats the purpose of vaporizing, at least with regard to health effects.  Uses and abuses are discussed on /r/abv.

## **wand hash**

Condensed vapor that builds up in wands (and more broadly, along any part of the vapor path of any vape, whether or not it uses a wand).  It is golden brown in colour, and has a distinctive odour.  It can be harvested and re-vaped - though this may be inadvisable with parts such as whips, which may leech material which would be toxic to vape.

## **whip**

Flexible tubing (usually silicone or plastic - high-temperature-resistant in reputable models) attached to a wand, and used to inhale from.  It may also refer to the whip plus the wand (and perhaps mouthpiece) assembled.  Whips are only used with some vaporizers.
