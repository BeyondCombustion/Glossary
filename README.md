## **ABV** 

**A**lready **B**een **V**aped cannabis (Also known as AVB: **A**lready **V**aped **B**ud; vape poo; and duff).  It can be re-used for edibles or tinctures.  It may also be smoked - though this largely defeats the purpose of vaporizing, at least with regard to health effects.  Uses and abuses are discussed on [/r/abv](https://reddit.com/r/abv).

## **Enail**

A combination of devices brought together are called an "Enail", as well as some of the components that make up an enail. 

They include: 
- A PID/controller (typically one of two different common, but electrically incompatable pin layouts are used for the controller)
- A enail coil (typically one of two different common, but electrically incompatable pin layouts are used for the enail coil)

#### Always verify the pin layout of the coil and controller before making a purchase or attempting use. Failure to do so may damage your coil or controller, or cause you electric shock.
